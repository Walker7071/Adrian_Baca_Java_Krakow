# Payment Optimization

A Java 21 application that selects the optimal payment method for orders, maximizing discounts and minimizing card usage, according to the specification.

## Requirements

- Java 21 (e.g., Amazon Corretto)
- Maven 3.9.0 or higher

## Executable

The project already includes a compiled executable `app.jar` located in the `target/` directory.

You can use it immediately without building the project.

## Building the Application (Optional)

If you want to build the application yourself (e.g., after making changes to the code):

1. Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP and extract it.
2. In the root directory, run:

    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

3. The resulting `.jar` file will be located in the `target/` directory with the name:

    ```
    app.jar
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the program, use the following command in the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
java -jar target/app.jar data/orders.json data/paymentmethods.json
